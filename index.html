I'm a front end Web developer and UI designer from Toronto, ON.<br>
I enjoy creating interactive media designs and developing websites in order to create something new in it.<br>
I'm fulltime freelancer who specializes in creating dynamic and beautiful web pages. I have been working in this field ever since the<br>
day I finish my graduation and have been loving every single minute of it. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Post grad in Advanced Multimedia in Interactive<br> Web Design from Fanshawe college, London, ON.<br>
